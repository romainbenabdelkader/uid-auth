🇺🇸 UID_AUTH - U.S. Version

Open Standard for Creative Works Traceability (U.S. Edition)
Compliance Ready for U.S. Copyright Law, DMCA, and Fair Use Challenges

UID_AUTH is an open and neutral manifest format for certifying the origin, integrity, and AI-training rights of creative works (music, video, text, images)

It is designed as a voluntary standard for U.S. creators and organizations (ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, RIAA, MLC, publishers, indie artists) to establish verifiable provenance, protect works against unauthorized AI training, and support litigation-grade evidence under U.S. copyright law

Why UID_AUTH matters in the U.S.

The United States has no equivalent to the European AI Act.

AI training falls under fair use, evaluated case-by-case.

UID_AUTH provides creators and rights organizations with:

•	A verifiable origin manifest (proof a human created the work)

•	A cryptographic integrity hash (SHA-256)

•	AI training rights declarations compatible with U.S. litigation

•	DMCA-friendly metadata (anti-scraping, anti-circumvention)

•	A voluntary national identifier namespace (e.g. US-2025-XXXX)

•	Compatible with ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, MLC, and major DSPs

•	Optional integration with Content Credentials / C2PA

UID_AUTH does not replace ISRC/ISWC/ISNI.
It adds the missing layer: 
verifiable provenance native inside the file.
